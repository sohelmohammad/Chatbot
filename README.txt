ChatterPatter
--------------------------------------------------------
Python Chat Application
( Please Star this if you like this or have used this . It's free :)  )
--------------------------------------------------------
ChatterPatter is a simple GUI based chat application which includes both SERVER AND CLIENT scirpts in same application. Simple in front , complex in back . So complex that even the developer fears going through it again and again.
Developed solely on Python.

Python Libraries and Modules Used

- Sockets
- Threading
- Tkinter (Tabs , Listbox , Labels , Entry , etc.)
- Coomments (ðŸ˜…)
- IDE Used : PyCharm
- and a lot âœ¨Magic âœ¨
--------------------------------------------------------

Features
- Works only on LAN , so all devices must be connected to same network
- Colorful Interface
- An instructions tab as well to clarify the usage
- Create a Server Room
- Embbeded a partial client with Server Room so as the Room Maker need not to join with the client as well
- Clients can join easily with the room code generated
- Close Room option closes the sockets and rooms
- All the chats are shown to everyone and the server can see when someone has joined
- Users can also use their own names to chat by entering it in the entry boxes ( Completely Optional )

Note from Developer
> The idea behind this project is nothing.
> I wanted to create something for my blank github profile
> And also wanted to learn python
> And also wanted to create a chat application as my first project
> So , this is for me and others who might need it sometime in life
> Cheers to python
-- Said by the Developer

And of course **Chatterpatter** itself is open source on Github :)

--------------------------------------------------------

Installation
- Python must be installed on the system to run it
- No external things are required ( I don't think so )

--------------------------------------------------------

Executing the Program 
There are two ways to execute the program
 - Using CMD : Open the folder in CMD first and execute the following code >>
```bash
>> MainFile.py
or
>> python MainFile.py
```
- Using MainFile.exe included : Just run the MainFile.exe file included in the MainFile directory or you can also use the shortcut of the same made in the root directory

--------------------------------------------------------

.exe Made with the help of Auto-py-to-exe : https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/

--------------------------------------------------------

Future of this ??
The future of anything is uncertain . Same goes for this as well . I am not sure If I would come back to this or not . But If I come across using sockets on global level , I would surely implement on this . But currenctly , I can't say anything .
